# Levee-aware downscaling (archive)

This archive contains parameterised scripts to (1) compute n-year storage for Natural and Leveed scenarios, and (2) downscale simulated flood volume (flood storage) to 1-second (Hi-res) flood depths over a user-specified bbox.

See `REPRODUCE.md` for step-by-step instructions.
